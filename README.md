# SFML-Basic-Pong

Basic Pong game created with SFML what it contains: 2 players and a ball in the shape of a circle.
I made a ball that collides between the walls and the bats.
Whoever reaches the score of 3 first wins.
Sometimes there are still problems with the collision between the bat and the ball.

Enter the names of the players at the beginning.

If you want to play this game you need SFML library.
